    <h2>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h2>
    <h3>An Oracle of Chaotic Shifts</h3>
    <p>This oracle deck is inspired by the surreal multiverse logic of Everything Everywhere All At Once. Each of its 32 cards corresponds to a path or sefirah from the Tree of Life and offers a seemingly absurd, playful, or deeply disorienting action â€” a ritualized glitch in reality. These actions are designed not to provide answers, but to open portals: to confuse logic, break perception, and slip sideways into parallel possibilities. Pull a card, perform the action, and see which version of yourself arrives on the other side.</p>
