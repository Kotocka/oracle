Everything Everywhere All At Once 
An Oracle of Chaotic Shifts 

This oracle deck is inspired by the surreal multiverse logic of Everything Everywhere All At Once. Each of its 32 cards corresponds to a path or sefirah from the Tree of Life and offers a seemingly absurd, playful, or deeply disorienting action â€” a ritualized glitch in reality. These actions are designed not to provide answers, but to open portals: to confuse logic, break perception, and slip sideways into parallel possibilities. Pull a card, perform the action, and see which version of yourself arrives on the other side.
